			<h2>Hello</h2>
				<p><strong>Keith Winfield</strong> is a designer, front-end developer and family guy. I like to think designing web interfaces has to be one of the most challenging and rewarding careers. Requiring constant upgrading of knowledge, meeting demanding deadlines and finding solutions to problems. It's what I love.

			In my spare time, I spend as much time with my family as possible. I have an incredibly beautiful and patient wife, Freida and two wonderful children. Chances are, youâ€™ll find me either in front of a computer screen, challenging my brain with a game, or with my family.</p>

				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>In 2004 I was introduced to Adobe products and coding HTML. I began working on a website to sell t-shirts. I used Photoshop to adjust images I pulled online. When I found that writing code allowed me to create layouts with my images and text, I thought I was off to the races. I was coding HTML, uploading my files to "godaddy.com" ftp accounts, adjusting images using Photoshop and Aftereffects. Only, I did not realize the significance of the skills I was learning or, better yet, how I could put those skill to work for me financially in the present and future.<br><br>I became a family man, marrying a beautiful woman and having two beautiful children, but unfortunately that meant "playing on my computer" had to take a backseat. I took a temporary assignment for maybe the largest HVAC company in the world as a dispatcher where I dispatched HVAC technicians nationwide. 10 years later I had risen to management for a small HVAC company in Baltimore. I never lost the urge to create and I always kept up with the latest coding languages and web development trends as well as freelancing for family and friends. I would always go the extra mile creating flyers, ads, writing programs, and creating spreadsheets using Microsoft Office products trying to make jobs easier for all employees.</p>
